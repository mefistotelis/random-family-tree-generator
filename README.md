# random-family-tree-generator

## Description

Here you will find scripts capable of generating random family trees. The output is saved as [GEDCOM file](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM).

## Rationale

While it might be funny to start uploading random trees to sites providing paid services based on free-of-charge data from users, the intended use for these scripts is stress-testing the offline family tree apps.

## Usage

Run with `--help` to get a list of options.
